# Run: {run_id}

## Objective
Produce an inspection-ready “Proof & Provenance Pack” for this run under runs/{run_id}/evidence/.

## Context
- This lab is research-first and non-commercial.
- External frontier models are allowed only if explicitly justified with expected outcomes and cost/benefit notes.
- Findings remain internal unless explicitly marked “publishable” after review.

## Inputs
- Mindset / intervention: {describe}
- Data sources available locally: {list}
- Constraints: do not exfiltrate private data; keep PII segregated.

## Required Outputs (must exist)
Create these files under runs/{run_id}/evidence/:
1) dossier.json
2) hashes.manifest.json (sha256 for every artifact in this run folder)
3) ledger_entry.json (single entry ready to append to EVIDENCE_LEDGER/ledger.jsonl)
4) ralph/ folder copied from .agent (prompts, metrics, logs)

## Verification
Create or update runs/{run_id}/verify.sh that:
- checks required files exist
- validates JSON parses
- recomputes sha256 and matches hashes.manifest.json
- exits 0 on success

## Success Criteria
Task is complete only when:
- verify.sh exits 0
- dossier.json contains model IDs, prompts/system policy, sampling params, tool usage summary, git commit hash, and timestamps
- ledger_entry.json references hashes.manifest.json root hash

## Progress Log
- [ ] Generate dossier.json skeleton
- [ ] Collect Ralph artifacts from .agent
- [ ] Produce hashes.manifest.json
- [ ] Produce ledger_entry.json
- [ ] verify.sh passes

## Checkpoints
- [ ] CHECKPOINT_1: dossier schema complete
- [ ] CHECKPOINT_2: hashes + ledger entry created
- [ ] CHECKPOINT_3: verify.sh green
- [ ] All criteria verified
